📄 README: Adaptive Facade Panels (Elytra AdPanels) Plugin for Grasshopper
📅 Version: 1.0
🛠️ Compatible with: Rhino 7 (Windows)
📂 Platform: Grasshopper for Windows

📌 Introduction
Elytra AdPanels is a Grasshopper plugin that enables the creation of parametric facade panels with custom spacing, boundary offsets, and solar adaptation. It allows users to generate dynamic panels that respond to environmental conditions and integrate seamlessly with computational design workflows.

📥 Installation Instructions
1️⃣ Download & Extract
Download the latest version of Elytra.zip.
Extract the ZIP file to a temporary folder.

2️⃣ Move Plugin File to Grasshopper Libraries
Locate Grasshopper's Libraries folder:

Open Rhino.
Type _GrasshopperFolders in the command bar.
Click on Components.
This opens the Grasshopper Libraries folder.
Move the .gha file
Copy Elytra.gha from the extracted folder.
Paste it inside the Grasshopper Libraries folder.

3️⃣ Unblock the File (Important!)
Right-click on Elytra.gha.
Click Properties.
Check "Unblock" (if available).
Click Apply and OK.

4️⃣ Restart Rhino & Grasshopper
Close Rhino and Grasshopper.
Reopen Rhino, then launch Grasshopper (_Grasshopper command).
The Adaptive Panels components should now be available in Grasshopper under the "Panels" category.

🎮 Getting Started

1️⃣ Add the Component
Open Grasshopper.
Find Adaptive Panels in the Grasshopper component toolbar.
Drag and drop the Adaptive Panels component onto the canvas.

2️⃣ Set the Required Inputs
Facade Surface: Select the surface where the panels will be placed.
Panel Width & Height: Set the panel dimensions (in mm).
Horizontal & Vertical Spacing: Define gaps between the panels.
Boundary Offset: Prevents panels from crossing the facade edges.
Solar Radiation Input: Adjusts panels based on solar exposure.

3️⃣ Generate Panels
Connect the inputs and panels will be automatically generated based on the given parameters.
💡 Example File is included in the ZIP package
